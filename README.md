# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to run the Maxins project in VS Code on your local machine:

âœ… Step 0: Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Tool	Download Link
VS Code	https://code.visualstudio.com/
Node.js	https://nodejs.org/
Git	https://git-scm.com/

ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can use nvm to manage Node.js versions (optional but recommended).

âœ… Step 1: Open VS Code and Clone the Repo
Open VS Code.

Open the built-in terminal:

Ctrl + ~ (Windows/Linux)

Cmd + ~ (macOS)

Run the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/mmmchu/Maxins.git
cd Maxins
âœ… Step 2: Install Dependencies
Once inside the Maxins folder, install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This installs all the packages listed in package.json (like React, Vite, Tailwind, etc.).

âœ… Step 3: Run the Development Server
After installation completes, start the local dev server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
You should see output like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
  VITE vX.X.X  ready in XX ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
âœ… Step 4: Open the Project in a Browser
Click or copy the link (e.g., http://localhost:5173/) into your browser to see your website in action!

âœ… Step 5: Optional â€“ Enable Auto Preview in VS Code
Install the Live Server or Vite extension (optional).

Or just let npm run dev keep running; any file change will auto-refresh the browser.

ðŸ”„ Next Time You Want to Run It
When you come back to the project later:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Maxins
npm install      # Only once â€“ skip if already installed
npm run dev
